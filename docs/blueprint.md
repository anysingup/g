# **App Name**: Harinkhaine Result Portal

## Core Features:

- School Information Display: Display the school's name (Harinkhaine Government Primary School), EMIS code (91411050804), and address (Village: Harinkhaine, Ward No: 6, Post Office: Budhpura) on the homepage.
- Result Lookup Form: Implement a form for parents to select the student's class (1-5), exam type (first terminal, second terminal, annual), and enter their roll number.
- Dynamic Grade Report Generation: After submitting the form, generate and display the student's results for the selected class and exam, including marks for Bangla, Math, English, Bangladesh & World Affairs, Elementary Science, Islam Religion, Physical Education, Arts & Crafts, and Music. Include both the 70-mark term-end assessment and the 30-mark continuous assessment scores.
- Multilingual Support Tool: Use AI to ensure that the interface can provide tips and guidance for the guardian regardless of the language they use.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light sky blue (#87CEEB), reminiscent of clear skies, and communicates trustworthiness and accessibility.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF). This provides a gentle backdrop that ensures readability and minimizes visual strain.
- Accent color: Muted orange (#E07A5F), complementing the primary blue while drawing attention to important interactive elements such as buttons.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif that balances a modern aesthetic with a touch of warmth. Suitable for both headings and longer text.
- Use clean, simple icons for indicating each class and exam type in the forms. Icons should be easily recognizable and contextually relevant.
- Maintain a clean and intuitive layout, ensuring that the school information is prominently displayed at the top, followed by a clear, well-structured result lookup form. The student's result should then be neatly presented after the form submission.
- Implement subtle transitions and loading animations to enhance the user experience. These animations should be unobtrusive and serve to provide feedback during interactions, such as submitting the result lookup form.
